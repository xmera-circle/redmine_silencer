    Please note that Redmine Silencer cannot control an issue which you select to make a copy from when you configured copied issues to be linked by default!

    When you would like to avoid notifying users that an issue is copied then you should modify your settings in Administration -> Configuration -> Issues -> Link issues on copy.
